# 📘 Linear Regression – AI & ML Internship Task (Elevate Labs)

This repository contains the complete solution for *Task 3: Linear Regression* from the *AI & ML Internship Program* by Elevate Labs (USME, Govt. of India).

The task covers implementing and understanding *simple & multiple linear regression* using:
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

---

## 📌 Objective
Build and analyze a Linear Regression model to predict a continuous variable using a suitable dataset (e.g., house price prediction).

## 🧠 Steps Performed

### ✔ 1. Loaded and explored dataset  
- Checked first rows  
- Verified missing values  
- Identified features & target  

### ✔ 2. Preprocessed data  
- Selected relevant columns  
- Prepared X (features) and y (target)

### ✔ 3. Train-test split  
Performed 80-20 split using train_test_split.

### ✔ 4. Trained Linear Regression Model  
Used:

LinearRegression() from sklearn


### ✔ 5. Evaluated using:  
- *MAE* – Mean Absolute Error  
- *MSE* – Mean Squared Error  
- *RMSE* – Root Mean Squared Error  
- *R² Score* – Goodness of fit  

### ✔ 6. Interpreted Model Output  
- Intercept  
- Feature coefficients  
- Checking model performance  

### ✔ 7. Visualized Regression line  
(if dataset had only one independent feature)

## 🧪 Results
The script prints:
- Dataset preview  
- Training/testing samples  
- Model errors (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²)  
- Feature coefficients  
- Intercept

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### *1️⃣ Install dependencies*

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib


### *2️⃣ Place dataset*
Add your dataset as:

house_price.csv


### *3️⃣ Run the script*

python linear_regression.py

## 📝 Interview Questions (with answers)

### *1. What assumptions does Linear Regression make?*
- Linearity  
- No multicollinearity  
- Homoscedasticity  
- Normal distribution of errors  
- Independence of observations  

### *2. How do you interpret coefficients?*  
A coefficient tells how much the target variable changes when the feature increases by 1 unit (keeping other features constant).

### *3. What is R² Score?*  
It measures how much variance in the target variable is explained by the model.

### *4. When do we prefer MSE over MAE?*  
When we want to penalize large errors more strongly.

### *5. How do you detect multicollinearity?*  
- Correlation matrix  
- VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)

### *6. Difference between Simple & Multiple Regression?*  
- Simple → 1 independent feature  
- Multiple → 2 or more independent features  

### *7. Can Linear Regression be used for classification?*  
Not ideal; Logistic Regression is used instead.

### *8. What happens if regression assumptions are violated?*  
Model becomes unreliable, inaccurate, and unstable.
